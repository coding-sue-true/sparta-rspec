# sparta-rspec

## Main

The main purpose of this repo was to write conditions to complement and successfully pass the tests.
Also we've learnt how to write our code as dry as possible.

We've done testing for FizzBuzz challenge, which can be found inside 'FizzBuzz' folder and also a simple test for the basic calculations 'rspec_calculator'.

Project Euler is a series of challenges and we solved the first two in class, writing the code and testing it using rspec.
